### Imperative paradigm

These are Procedural and object-oriented programming like C, C++, C#, PHP, Java and of course Assembly.
We focus more on creating statements that change program states by creating algorithms that tell the computer how to do things with the help of conditinal statements, loops and class inheritence.

### Declarative paradigm

It focuses more on building logic of software without actually **describing its flow**. Examples would be HTML, XML, CSS, SQL, etc. For example with HTML you use `<img src="./image.jpg" />` to tell browser to display an image and you donâ€™t care how it does that.
